# Example ToDo-Web-App

A simple node JS REST API using Express as well as Mongoose and MongoDB for persistence. 
The application can be imported with repl.it by choosing "Import from GitHub".
Then create an `.env` file and set the `MONGODB_HOST=example.com` and `MONGODB_DATABASE=some-name` for your MongoDB instance.

## Run Local

You need to install Node.js and NPM. Run `npm install` in order to install dependencies. Start the API with:

```
MONGODB_HOST=localhost MONGODB_DATABASE=example node index.js
```
